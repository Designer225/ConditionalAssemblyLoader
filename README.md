# ConditionalAssemblyLoader
This is a repository for the conditional assembly loader project, which offers a way to
conditionally load assemblies at runtime depending on runtime conditions.
The goal is to allow users to isolate code that would otherwise change from version to version
and reference version-specific code via dependency injection.
